## What does it do (short story)

In short, disuware is a CLI tool for starting nodejs applications, which are built
by composing modules. Disuware will provide a dependency injection system on top of
the nodejs native module loading to enable you composing your modules, as well as
load the modules itself in an order, that they work well.
